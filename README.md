# Firefox-Default-Profile-Switcher
Switches the default Firefox profile without needing to access the `about:profiles` tab. Useful for opening links in a specific profile, since Firefox automatically opens links in the default profile, and lacks the native ability to choose the profile to open in.


## Usage
In the directory of the file:
```bash
$ py main.py <PROFILE_NAME>
```

Using `pipenv`, in the directory of the file:
```bash
$ pipenv run py main.py <PROFILE_NAME>
```
